# desicion-tree-algorithm
## Description
+ Hand-crafted decision tree algorithm
+ Including ID3, C4.5, and CART
+ Impurity: Misclassification error, Entropy, Gini index
+ Goal is to predict which valuable employees will leave next, and compare with Sklearn result.
+ Analyze different hyperparameters(Tree depth)
+ Experimentï¼š
1. Run 10 times of 80/20 and 20/80 data splitting.
2. Use 10-fold cross validation.
